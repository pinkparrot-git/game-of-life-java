# game-of-life-java
A simple implementation of Conwayâ€™s Game of Life using Java. It simulates the evolution of cellular automata on a 2D grid, following the standard rules defined by John Conway. The program runs in the console, prints the grid at each generation, and includes a sample pattern (Glider).
